# OmniAuth Facebook &nbsp;[![Build Status](http://travis-ci.org/mkdynamic/omniauth-facebook.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mkdynamic/omniauth-facebook)

Facebook OAuth2 Strategy for OmniAuth 1.0.

Supports the OAuth 2.0 server-side and client-side flows. Read the Facebook docs for more details: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication

*Edge:* Also supports authentication for [Facebook app pages/canvas](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/), via parsing the [signed request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/signed_request/). Take a look at [the example Sinatra app for how to integrate with a canvas page](https://github.com/mkdynamic/omniauth-facebook/blob/master/example/config.ru).

## Installing

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-facebook'
```

Then `bundle install`.

## Usage

`OmniAuth::Strategies::Facebook` is simply a Rack middleware. Read the OmniAuth 1.0 docs for detailed instructions: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :facebook, ENV['FACEBOOK_KEY'], ENV['FACEBOOK_SECRET']
end
```

[See the example Sinatra app for full examples](https://github.com/mkdynamic/omniauth-facebook/blob/master/example/config.ru) of both the server and client-side flows (including using the Facebook Javascript SDK).

## Configuring

You can configure several options, which you pass in to the `provider` method via a `Hash`:

* `scope`: A comma-separated list of permissions you want to request from the user. See the Facebook docs for a full list of available permissions: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/permissions. Default: `email,offline_access`
* `display`: The display context to show the authentication page. Options are: `page`, `popup`, `iframe`, `touch` and `wap`. Read the Facebook docs for more details: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs#display. Default: `page`
* `secure_image_url`: Set to `true` to use https for the avatar image url returned in the authentication hash. Default is `false`.

For example, to request `email`, `offline_access` and `read_stream` permissions and display the authentication page in a popup window:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :facebook, ENV['FACEBOOK_KEY'], ENV['FACEBOOK_SECRET'],
           :scope => 'email,offline_access,read_stream', :display => 'popup'
end
```

### Per-Request Options

If you want to set the `display` format or `scope` on a per-request basis, you can just pass it to the OmniAuth request phase URL, for example: `/auth/facebook?display=popup` or `/auth/facebook?scope=email`.

You can also pass through a `state` param which will be passed along to the callback url.

### Custom Callback URL/Path

You can set a custom `callback_url` or `callback_path` option to override the default value. See [OmniAuth::Strategy#callback_url](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/blob/master/lib/omniauth/strategy.rb#L387) for more details on the default.

## Authentication Hash

Here's an example *Authentication Hash* available in `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:

```ruby
{
  :provider => 'facebook',
  :uid => '1234567',
  :info => {
    :nickname => 'jbloggs',
    :email => 'joe@bloggs.com',
    :name => 'Joe Bloggs',
    :first_name => 'Joe',
    :last_name => 'Bloggs',
    :image => 'http://graph.facebook.com/1234567/picture?type=square',
    :urls => { :Facebook => 'http://www.facebook.com/jbloggs' },
    :location => 'Palo Alto, California',
    :verified => true
  },
  :credentials => {
    :token => 'ABCDEF...', # OAuth 2.0 access_token, which you may wish to store
    :expires_at => 1321747205, # when the access token expires (if it expires)
    :expires => true # if you request `offline_access` this will be false
  },
  :extra => {
    :raw_info => {
      :id => '1234567',
      :name => 'Joe Bloggs',
      :first_name => 'Joe',
      :last_name => 'Bloggs',
      :link => 'http://www.facebook.com/jbloggs',
      :username => 'jbloggs',
      :location => { :id => '123456789', :name => 'Palo Alto, California' },
      :gender => 'male',
      :email => 'joe@bloggs.com',
      :timezone => -8,
      :locale => 'en_US',
      :verified => true,
      :updated_time => '2011-11-11T06:21:03+0000'
    }
  }
}
```

The precise information available may depend on the permissions which you request.

## Client-side Flow

The client-side flow supports parsing the authorization code from the signed request which Facebook puts into a cookie. This means you can to use the Facebook Javascript SDK as you would normally, and you just hit the callback endpoint (`/auth/facebook/callback` by default) once the user has authenticated in the `FB.login` success callback.

See the example Sinatra app under `example/` for more details.

## Supported Rubies

Actively tested with the following Ruby versions:

- MRI 1.9.3
- MRI 1.9.2
- MRI 1.8.7
- JRuby 1.6.5

*NB.* For JRuby, you'll need to install the `jruby-openssl` gem. There's no way to automatically specify this in a Rubygem gemspec, so you need to manually add it your project's own Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jruby-openssl', :platform => :jruby
```
